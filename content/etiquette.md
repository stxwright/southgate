We want all riders to enjoy the fun, motivation and camaraderie of club riding. Below are some tips for riding safely in a group and some simple hand signals to look out for!

## Safety Tips

### Avoid Half-Wheeling
Try and avoid half-wheeling! This is where half of your bike is overlapping with half of someone else's bike. This can be dangerous, as if the bike in front of you needs to swerve to avoid a hazard, you may not see it and they may catch you. Ideally position yourself behind or right alongside another club mate.

### Group Communication
Your club mates will wherever possible try and signal what's going on in the road ahead, so that if you are behind you can prepare accordingly!

## Hand Signals

*   **Slowing Down**: Raising your arm to the side and making as if to "pat an invisible dog."
*   **Hazard in the road**: Point at the hazard! It really helps to add a shout too, e.g., "hole left" so riders know to move right.
*   **Moving Out**: Sometimes we need to move out further into the lane. Pointing or gesturing with a bent arm behind your back indicates where the group needs to move.

## On-the-Move Courtesy

We get it - everyone needs to blow their nose or spit occasionally. When on the move, please do so away from other riders, being mindful of the wind!

If you need a comfort break, just shout! Let the ride leader know and they will find a convenient place to pull in.
