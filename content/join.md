## FAQs

*   **Am I the sort of person you are looking for?**
    Almost certainly! Our members are young and old, male and female, and from many ethnicities. We are a friendly informal club and we are not elitist.

*   **How fit do I need to be?**
    You should be able to cycle 40 miles over rolling countryside in about three hours. If you are not sure of your fitness, build yourself up to 40 miles or so first. You don't need to be fast but you may need some endurance.

*   **What sort of bike do I need?**
    Most members ride lightweight road bikes with drop handlebars, but you are welcome to ride any bike so long as it's roadworthy.

*   **What happens if I can't keep up?**
    The group always rides at a pace that allows everyone to stay together. We regroup at junctions and the top of hills. We'll always assist you in getting back if you cannot continue.

*   **Do you stop during the ride?**
    Yes. The regular Sunday ride has a cafe stop generally about 20 miles in. From there you can return for a 40-45 mile total, or continue for a 60-80 mile total.

*   **Should I bring food and drink with me?**
    Bring at least one water bottle and some food (energy bars, banana, etc.) just in case.

*   **Do I need lycra clothing?**
    You can wear whatever you please, but cycle-specific clothing is more comfortable and practical.

*   **Do I need to wear a helmet?**
    There is no law requiring a helmet, but we strongly recommend wearing one.

*   **What else should I bring with me?**
    A spare inner tube, tyre levers, a pump, cash for the cafe, ID, and a mobile phone. Bring lights if there's any chance of riding in the dark.

*   **I’m ready to take the plunge - what do I do now?**
    Just turn up a little before 9am on a Sunday morning at Caffè Nero in Enfield Town and introduce yourself to the ride leader!

*   **Do I have to join the club before I am allowed to participate in a ride?**
    No – we invite prospective members to accompany us on three rides before applying to join.

*   **What does it cost to join?**
    See the fees above. We also require members to join either British Cycling or Cycling UK for insurance purposes.
