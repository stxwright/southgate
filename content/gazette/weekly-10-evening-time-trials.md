The first of this year’s Weekly 10 Mile Time Trials is next Wednesday, 14th June at Brickendon Green. The events run every Wednesday until 20th July, 6 in total.

The time trials are open to everyone regardless of experience and standard so come along and give it a try. You can set your own time for you to improve on during the series and you'll enjoy the sociable atmosphere. There are awards, of course, for the fastest rider, for the most improved rider and for the fastest novice. These will be presented at the Club's Annual Dinner in December.

The course is a 10 mile long loop starting on Brickendon Lane just after the Farmers Boy pub and finishing on Brickendon Green just before the junction of Pembridge Lane and Brickendon Lane. I've attached a GPX and map of the course. The course will be marked with direction arrows and marshalls at key points. The route is also available on RidewithGPS: [https://ridewithgps.com/routes/35606800](https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fridewithgps.com%2Froutes%2F35606800&data=05%7C01%7C%7C212969379045423f1e9608db686c53ee%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638218586860480329%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=aWqqgSd1Bf46TT%2B8u5SbVh%2FaYTTtsgjMv3s36Ud3qzA%3D&reserved=0)
