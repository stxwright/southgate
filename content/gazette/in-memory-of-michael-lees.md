### Remembering our Dear Friend and club member

![](/images/gazette/b57d3361-5707-4b69-af66-7090da456a27-1920w.JPG)

Our dear friend and fellow club member Mike Lees died suddenly on 6th April 2024 on the way to the Opera with his wife Ginny. I know this would have been a huge shock to us all, not least because he was always so healthy, fit and robust. Receiving the message about Mike's passing hit us all like a thunderbolt and the outpouring of love and emotion that followed is a true reflection of the esteem in which Mike was held.

Mike joined the club in 2013, becoming General Secretary in 2016. His love affair with cycling started as a young boy growing up near Backpool, where his father was an engineer who did work at the pleasure beach. Mike often talked about his cycling adventures in the Northwest as well as his avid support for his local team Fleetwood Town.

Each of us will have our own memories and stories about Mike, my own memories of him go back a long way. Being the same age and both studying Architecture, we arrived in London to work for a year to complete our studies. After qualifying we found ourselves working for the same Practice. We played cricket there and we laughed over beers and talked about finding places to do up and starting a family. Fast forward a few years, Mike and Ginny are living in Muswell Hill with their four children; Imogen, Miranda, Rupert & Freddie and our paths cross again when our daughters end up in the same class at school.

It is difficult to explain such a sudden loss to ourselves. The emotions that we all feel will be different. What I can be certain of is that Mike was a superb General Secretary, who was always organised, prepared and willing to help in any way he could. He served the club brilliantly, he was liked and respected and he will be very sorely missed.

He had that that knowing smile and dry wit that could turn an ordinary conversation into something altogether more interesting and insightful, and often had us in fits of laughter. Mike had a calmness about him and an uncanny ability to put you at ease, to make you feel welcome, and part of the group. He was always there to offer helpful advice or explain some technical aspect of bike mechanics that I'm sure many of us found baffling but incredibly useful. Mike was just a top, top bloke and we shall all miss him.

Rest in peace
