Southgate CC members attended: John and Pat, Ian, Andy, Tat, Bella and Phil and three Steves

﻿FRIDAY

Ten SCCC members signed up for the 50th anniversary of the first Cycling Dieppe Raid. There was a bumper turnout for this event and hundreds of cyclists arrived by various transport modes at Newhaven Ferry. Eight of us made Friday’s morning crossing to a warm welcome and bright sunshine in Dieppe. But when you think you are on easy street there is danger at the door as a tumultuous black cloud rolled off la Manche, gathering force as it hit the land and dropping a wall of rain drops the size of golf balls on top of us while we waited in a long line on the quay for les Douanes. The interminable wait felt like an hour (but was actually only fifteen minutes) and eventually passed and we were officially in France. Fortunately the port was only a short ride from the town. The hotel and apartments (ably organised by John) had great drying facilities and bike storage. Urgently needing refreshment the group convened at the nearby Les Tribunaux, who provided vital sustenance throughout the trip. Among others, the writer came a devotee of Leffe Blonde on this trip. Later we enjoyed the first of three dinners on the nearby Dieppe Quay.

SATURDAY

Bella and Phil, who had been on the previous evening’s crossing, joined us on a bright Saturday morning which gave us a chance to visit the huge Dieppe market with every known culinary delight provided. The Southgate ten then set out for what proved to be a generally cold wet ride along the Avenue Verte for 30 kilometers to Neufchatel-en-Bray, famous for its heart shaped soft cheese. We stopped for lunch at Le Chapeau Rouge in the town square.

After a good lunch, calvados and a following wind we were primed for a fast return to Dieppe along the avenue verte. Much anticipation over dinner for Sunday’s Tour des Trois Vallees ride was cautioned a bit by an extraordinary cloud formation outside the restaurant. Steve Wright’s phrase (new to the southerners in the party) “Bit black over Bill’s mother’s” summed up prospects for Sunday.

SUNDAY

Expecting more rain we were delighted by a bright morning. Pat and John set off late and opted for the 30 km route , and the rest of the group departed at 8am for the 100 km Tour des Trois Vallees from the FFCT HQ at Salle Paul Elvard. Once out of Dieppe our fears of poor weather disappeared and we enjoyed a fine day in the French countryside.

There is something special about cycling in north France in the summer: the immaculate roads that allow confident descents, the rolling hills that you can climb in the top ring, the tidy villages surrounded by arable dairy and orchards, the good climbs, the excellent views. Just all perfect.

We returned to the FFCT HQ and a post ride drink or three at Les Tribs before dinner at a third quayside restaurant.

MONDAY

After cafe and croissants at the quay, 8 of us returned on the 11am ferry. Various prizes were not handed out, but if they had been Bella would have won the videographer award, Ian the fastest pedalling on a downhill section, Andy the late night Bon Viveur award, Tat a special award for sacrificing a trip to the Glastonbury festival to slum it with us, Pat the friendly to the French prize, Phil the most discerning culinary choices and the three Steves would have competed for the slowest puncture repair. Just leaving the Presidential award, as usual, for John. On arrival the group of eight split into 4 groups for the return to London. Tat by car, Ian and Andy by van, three Steves by train from Lewes and Bella and Phil by train from Brighton. Like an episode of Top Gear, it was a close race to get home to north London, the van winning by a few minutes.

Meanwhile, John and Pat stayed on till Tuesday, heading west along the coast to St.Valery. Their lunch was jinxed by a puncture so they survived on a subsistence of bread and cheese. They then visited the 51st Highland memorial at St.Valerie en Caux where upwards of 10,000 troops of the 51st Highland became POWs in 1940.

The original 1972 cycle ride was on the 30th anniversary of the military Dieppe Raid in August 1942 that saw many allied troops, predominantly Canadian, suffer terrible losses in a bold but misguided and unsuccessful attempt to regain Dieppe from the Nazis. Lessons were learnt for the successful D-Day Normandy landings two years later. Amongst the pleasures of a weekend in France 80 years later is a reminder to us today ... enjoy your freedoms while you can.
