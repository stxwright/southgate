## Other Riding Types

### Audax
Audax riding is not a race, not a tour, not a sportive, not a club run. Known internationally as 'a randonnee', it is a unique cycling experience. Though there are rides of all distances, Audax is famed for long distance, self-sufficient cycling (either solo or as a group). [Audax UK](https://audax.uk/) is the organising body.

### Cyclo Cross
Typically held 'off season', 'off road' and with obstacles, races and events are held on closed circuit courses. Check out the [Central Cyclo Cross League](https://centralcxl.org.uk/) and [London and South East Cyclo Cross League](http://www.londonxleague.co.uk/).

### Road Racing
Held either on open road or closed circuit (crits) there are several events held throughout the season. The most frequented by club members are [British Cycling](https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/events) and [British Masters Cycle Racing](https://bmcr.org.uk/).

### Time Trials
Time trials are individual events held around a set course to set distances (typically 10, 15, 25, 50, 100 miles). The main UK organiser is [Cycling Time Trials (CTT)](https://www.cyclingtimetrials.org.uk/). The Club is affiliated to CTT.

### Track / Velodrome
Racing and riding on fixed gear bikes at the Lea Valley Velodrome (indoor) or Gosling Sports Park (Welwyn, outdoor). Neighbouring club Welwyn Wheelers hosts a [Track League](https://www.welwynwheelers.org.uk/track-league).

### Sportives
Mass participation challenge rides held all over the country throughout the year and on all kinds of surfaces.
