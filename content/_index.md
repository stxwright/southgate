Come and join your local friendly Cycling Club.

 New members meet at 9am on Sundays at **Caffè Nero, Enfield Town**.

Established in 1882, **Southgate Cycling Club** has the distinction of being amongst the very earliest (and we feel very best) cycling clubs in the world.

## About Us

Nowadays, our mission is to embrace and enhance the popularity of cycling, whilst paying tribute to our illustrious history and traditions. We welcome all abilities and ages - you just need a working bike!

The club organises and participates in a variety of cycling events in and around London, Hertfordshire, Essex and surrounding areas, as well as enjoying organised UK and international cycling tours.

### Our Regular Rides

The mainstay of the club are the **Sunday Club Rides** (one at 'Touring' pace, the other at 'Training' pace) which between them usually attract between 30-40 members for a non-competitive spin out on the best cycling roads we can find around our north London base.

We also run:
- Saturday morning training rides
- Mid-week evening rides
- Time Trials in summer
- Annual Hill Climb challenge in October
- Regular club social nights throughout the year
- Annual night ride

We're always looking at fantastic new challenges to get involved in!

**We look forward to welcoming you on a ride soon!**
